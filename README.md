# pure-Javascript-kids-mind-game-project
This is pure java script project for kids. By this project children can enhance their mind. Here randomly generated simple operations are there. Player have to put the correct answer. Score board also available.
This is my own concept and I have tried my best to make this project productive.
___
## how I made:-
* Html and Css
* pure javascript
  * Proper DOM Manipulation ( input value retrieved and set value etc )
  * different Math functions like, Math.random(), Math.floor() etc.
  * used an unique conccept to choose operation randomly from a list of an array.
  * used score section, that changes dynamically as per user answe is correct or not
  * used also another two sections for showing number of correct and wrong. These also change dynamically.
  * used buzzer sound effect for correct and wrong answers.

This is a pure java script project. I have not used any external libraries like node js or react framework

* How it Works:-
  * step-1: First it will generates two random numbers and an operation(+,-,*or/)
  * step-2: User have to provide the answer on 'Your Ans' input box and will have to click the 'Check Ans' button
  * step-3: Now program match the user answer with the actual correct andwer of the given question.If it matched,
                Then it show a pop-up that your answer is corrct. If not matched shows answer not correct.
  * step-4: If the user answer is correct, then 5 will be added to the score. if wrong -3 will added. like this 
                score will changes dynamically.
  * step-5: Help section fetch the actual correct answer and for difficult question it will show you.
